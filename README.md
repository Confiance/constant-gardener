# constant-gardener
Examples of my approach and expertise to technical training and content development and management.
My name, Amina, means "someone trustworthy" in Arabic; Confiance is the same in French as I tend to use that as my digital handle :-)
Aspects of Learning & Development (L&D) work, such as technical training/documentation/knowledge management, can be viewed like gardening. It takes care and vigilant attention to have one's garden flourish and grow. The same applies to training technology, content management systems, and the like. L&D professionals such as myself, like gardeners, never stop digging. Hence, the moniker "Constant Gardener" (with of course nod to the LeCarre book/movie of the same title).
